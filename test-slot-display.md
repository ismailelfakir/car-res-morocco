# Slot Display Test Results

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes (`server/src/routes/magazins.routes.ts`)
1. **Modified availability endpoint** to return ALL slots instead of just available ones
2. **Added Slot import** to access the Slot model directly
3. **Updated slot retrieval logic** to fetch all slots for a given date and magazin

### Frontend Changes (`client/src/pages/Appointments.tsx`)
1. **Updated slot status mapping** to properly categorize slots:
   - `free`: No appointments taken (green)
   - `pending`: Some appointments taken but still has capacity (yellow)  
   - `full`: Fully booked or no capacity (red)

2. **Enhanced color scheme**:
   - Green: Available slots (clickable)
   - Yellow: Partially booked slots (not clickable)
   - Red: Fully booked slots (not clickable)

3. **Updated visual indicators**:
   - Checkmark icon for available slots
   - Clock icon for partially booked slots
   - Prohibition icon for fully booked slots

4. **Improved legend and counts**:
   - Clear status indicators with color coding
   - Updated terminology: "Partially Booked" instead of "Pending"
   - Real-time slot counts showing available/partial/full

## Expected Behavior

Now when users view the appointment booking page:

1. **All time slots are visible** regardless of their booking status
2. **Color coding clearly indicates**:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Available slots (users can click to book)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Partially booked slots (limited availability, not clickable)
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Fully booked slots (not available, not clickable)

3. **Visual feedback**:
   - Hover effects on available slots
   - Clear tooltips showing slot status
   - Icons that match the status
   - Real-time counts in the legend

## Testing Steps

1. Start both server and client development servers
2. Navigate to the appointments page
3. Select a service and location
4. Choose a date
5. Verify that all time slots are displayed with appropriate colors
6. Test booking a slot to see it change from green to yellow/red
7. Verify that partially booked and fully booked slots are not clickable

## Benefits

- **Better user experience**: Users can see all available time slots at a glance
- **Clear visual feedback**: Color coding makes it immediately obvious which slots are available
- **Reduced confusion**: Users understand why certain slots aren't available
- **Improved transparency**: Shows the full picture of slot availability
